   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to doctest2's documentation!
====================================


doctest2 is an attempt to make :mod:`doctest` even more awesome.
The package doctest2 is supplied because it is and will be a work 
in progress, and we would not expect anyone to monkeypatch our
work into their production versions of doctest.

So we would ask early-adopters to import doctest2 and use the tools 
provided within that context.

Feedback approeciated.
